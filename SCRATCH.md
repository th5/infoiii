CDM
Shared data model 
* Structural and semantic consistency across applications and deployments.
* Simplified integration and disambiguation of data that's collected from processes, digital interactions, product telemetry, people interactions, and so on.
* A unified shape, where data integrations can combine existing enterprise data with other sources and use that data holistically to develop apps or derive insights.
* The ability to extend the schema and Common Data Model standard entities to tailor the model to your organization.

OMOP

Methods
Inception cohort (clinical trial
Case control (smoking)
Logistic regression


Observational study = retroactive study



OMOP = PI tables + controlled vocabularies

controlled vocab are hierarchial (sql compatible) linked data: relationship, parent and children


PI

balanced maintainability, performance - sql vs imperative code

tables similar to OMOP, minus vocabulary
fields marked as blinded, and as pii (personally identifiable info)

app similar to REDCap
